A reimagining of the classic *Space Invaders*, but this time, Earth is the enemy. Destroy incoming ships, dodge bullets, and use your ultimate ability to obliterate everything.

Fast reflexes and smart timing are your best weapons. **Good luck, defender!**


## :space_invader: How to Play

- If an enemy bullet hits you, you **lose** a life.
- If an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen, you **lose** a life.
- You have **3 lives**. Lose all of them, and it's **game over**.
- Defeating an enemy increases your score by 1.
- Difficulty increases as you survive, up to a max at score 100.
